OldFragmate
===========

I call this project OldFragmate, since I reserve the name Fragmate for a future framework.

OldFragmate is only here to show you a framework that I have built. It is no longer developed.

The reason to not develop it anymore, is that when starting to use it for real, one big
problem was obvious, it was too hard to write advanced components with it. The main objective
for OldFragmate, was to make it really simple to create components. However, when the data that
the component was depending on changed, through onValueChanged, the developer had to do a lot
of DOM manipulations. There might be workarounds for that, by providing helper functions, but
it would not be a clean design. But, at that time, the React framework had been released, which
solved everything that OldFragmate was supposed to solve.

The OldFragmate code is still usable for some things, it shows that it is possible to create
a client-side JavaScript MVC framework with very little code, it shows how you can write tests
in a good way, and it is code that represents what I can accomplish.

I started to design OldFragmate in March 2013, and most of the implementation was finished by
November 2013.

Not all documentation is up to date, but there are example code, so it should be possible to
understand anyway.

So what will the new Fragmate be? It is still in the design phase, but one thing is clear, it
will be a framework based on the React library.
